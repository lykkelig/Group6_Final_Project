                        Employee attrition is the reduction in employee numbers. Attrition happens when the size of your workforce diminishes over time due to resignations, retirements, or employees that never get replaced. In the current employment market, employees are no longer restricted to working for companies geographically close to them. With the rise of remote work, post the arrival of COVID-19, the potential employer pool has significantly opened up.<br><br>
                        With this expanded pool of employers, employees are able to leave their current job more easily if they are unsatisfied for any reason, creating a higher risk of attrition rates for any company. Therefore it is critical for companies to understand the factors that lead to employee attrition.<br><br>
                        Using the IBM HR dataset, our analysis will identify the most significant metrics that affect employee attrition. This can then be used by HR departments implement strategies to retain employees.

                        In January of 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 4.25 million people quit their jobs. Some surveys indicate that up to 60% of people knew they would be looking for a new job within the next year. On average the cost of hiring a new employee is about $4,000. These costs can be broken down into three categories.<br><br>
                        The first bucket is recruiting. Different job boards have varying rates to help find employees. ZipRecruiter for example has packages that begin at $299 a month. Companies like LinkedIn offer a pay per click model. Additionally there's the cost associated with paying the HR staff to post the role and go through the initial screening process. Background checks depending on how complete they are, vary in rate too. Some can be as cheap as $50 while more extensive checks can cost as much as $200. After a suitable canidate is found and hired on average 100 man-hours have elapsed.<br><br>
                        Depending on the role, training may take longer or shorter than average. However on average companies spend 46.7 hours to train an employee. This can add an additional $1,000 in expenses.<br><br>
                        In addition to the base salary of an employee, companies incur the cost of spending money on benefits packages. These generally vary on the role and level of an employee. Though on average this can cost in the range of 1.2 - 1.4 times the base salary of the employee.<br><br>

                            After evaluating all five machine learning models the Logistical Regression model performed the best with an accuracy of 89.8%. We used hyperparameter tuning on all the models, however this did not change the results in a significant manner. Due to the number of options that can be exercised in hyperparameter tuning we are leaving this open for further research in the future. We've identified the following 10 features as having the greatest impact to employee attrition. Features are listed in order of importance:<br>
