Here are the steps:
1) Create the database in Postgres (See DDL below)
2) Create the code tables (DDL in: DDL Scripts for the Code Tables) on our GitHub
3) Import the CSV's into the individual code tables 
4) Create the Employee_Status table (DDL in: DDL Script for Table - Employee_Status) on our GitHub
5) Import the employee attrition CSV data into the Employee_Status table  
6) Verify everything by running SQL in file: SQL with Joins



CREATE DATABASE "Group6Final"
    WITH 
    OWNER = postgres
    ENCODING = 'UTF8'
    CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;
